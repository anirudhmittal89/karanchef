            | I have always been passionate about food since my childhood and nothing was more fascinating to me than food. I started cooking at the age of 16. I started off by cooking food for my family and friends. After getting a positive response and request for making the dishes again and again, I decided to pursue this as my career.

            p.lead Some of my favorite cooking shows are Masterchef Australia and Heston Blumenthal’s Search for Perfection. One of my favorite chef's is Heston Blumenthal that has motivated me to strive for perfection each time I cook. I keep researching on food and keep improving on flavors and techniques. I love to travel different places and enjoy their ethnic cuisine.

            p.lead I joined the <b>S.T.E.P. Program of the Oberoi Group of Hotels and Resorts</b>. I worked in the kitchen of Trident, Chennai for 3 years. I consider Chef Jamsheed Bhote as my mentor there who pushed me to improve my skills and taught me innumerous things. In my training at Trident, I worked in all the departments of kitchen. I undertook a lot of leadership roles such as organizing gourmet promotions and single handedly managed the operations of departments. I aim to express myself through the food I prepare, and through its textures and tastes, touching the heart of the diners.
            
            p.lead According to me, love for ingredients and passion of cooking is the most important drive for a chef. Working in kitchen involves a lot of hard-work but one compliment from a satisfied guest makes you forget all the difficulties and fills your heart with warmth. The pleasure of working in kitchen: for instance, the aroma of freshly baked bread, the sound of the crust of ciabatta, the touch of beef braised for hours...
